        <item> The Ronda Bullring, due to its history and architecture, its character and beauty, is recognized as one of the oldest and most monumental in existence. This is not by chance, since Ronda is considered one of the cradles of modern 18th century bullfighting. Century where, after the relief of the knights in the games with the bull, the Romero family emerged in the city, a family that for three generations brings together the most unique bullfighters of the time.
        The bullfighting boom led the Real Maestranza de Caballería de Ronda to erect its famous plaza, a work that is attributed to Martín de Aldehuela, the same architect of the great New Bridge over the Tajo de Ronda.
        Conceived in sandstone with a monumental scheme, the nobility of its architectural design, with its double gallery of arcades and the absence of exposed lines, gives it a spirit more of a cloister than an enclosure for bullfighting shows, recalling the circular courtyard of the famous Palace of Carlos V in the Alhambra in Granada.
        Covered with a gabled Arabic tile roof, the elegance of its interior is unmatched in any other bullring.</item>
        <item> After the collapse of the first new bridge in 1741, the need to improve this entrance to the city was raised due to the large flow of people and goods that were again forced to use it.
        The old Arab Gate of the Bridge was replaced and enlarged by the current one during the reign of the first Bourbon on the Spanish throne Felipe V, in 1742, as recorded in the stone inscription located next to the door.
        This emblematic monument of the city consists of a double ashlar arch, crowned by three pinnacles and adorned with the Anjou shell and the royal shield of the Bourbons on its outer face.</item>
        <item> It is located on Cuesta de Santo Domingo street. The first documentary evidence of this imposing house-palace dates from the 18th century, although it has undergone frequent restructuring as a result of successive changes of owner. The plan of the house is irregular and labyrinthine, with abundant stairs and corridors that serve to bridge the unevenness. The long façade adapts to the curve of the street and has two towers of different heights as well as two doors.
        Inside the water catchment mine is preserved, of Arab origin. It is a complex Islamic work that descends to the bottom of the Tagus where the Guadalevín River flows, which was built taking advantage of a vertical crack in the rock, where a staircase carved in the stone with more than 200 steps is developed and that descends vertically some 100 meters. Inside there are a series of rooms, from cisterns to rooms, which were used as a powder magazine and grain storage.</item>
        <item> Ronda's location on a rocky promontory has given it a marked strategic and defensive value throughout history. In Muslim times the Medina was located, clearly delimited both by the natural barrier that is the gorge excavated by the Guadalevín, and by the city walls themselves.
        Of the important preserved walled fence, we must highlight the Almocábar gate located in the southern sector of the medina, built in the 13th century and restructured in the period of Carlos V, it takes its name from the word “Al-maqabir It was one of The main access doors to the city and gave entry to the Barrio Alto, currently the Holy Spirit and the Muslim medina.

        <item> According to archaeological studies carried out in the area, this church was located very close to the remains of an early Christian basilica from the 5th century AD. Some historians also date back to Roman times when it served as a temple. This last point has not yet been archeologically proven.
        In the same place, the largest mosque in the Medina was built later under Islamic rule. Only the arch of the Mirhab and a part of the wall with an ataurique decoration are preserved from it, hidden behind the altarpiece of the altar of the tabernacle.
        The Catholic Monarchs, after the conquest of the city, ordered the building of the temple in the place of the mosque, whose works began in 1485 and after many vicissitudes, they were concluded at the end of the 17th century.

        <item> This thermal complex from the Muslim period is the best preserved in the Iberian Peninsula. It is located in the Old Islamic Quarter of the City, currently called the Barrio de San Miguel on the outskirts of what was at the time the Muslim Medina of Ronda.
        It was built between the 13th-14th centuries AD next to the Arroyo de las Culebras, to ensure the supply of water, which moved through a system of waterwheel, perfectly preserved today.
        These are structured in three fundamental areas, following the Roman model: cold, warm and hot bath rooms. Until now the hydraulic system of the same has practically arrived in its integrity.</item>
